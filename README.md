# NIMBUS: The CSAI Voice Assistant

![alt text](https://github.com/calpoly-csai/CSAI_Voice_Assistant/blob/master/Images/CalPoly-CSAI_cpcsai_rectanglefilled.png)

The "Cal Poly Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence" club is designing a voice assistant to provide the Cal Poly Computer Science department with relavent information about the department and university. The intent is for users to ask for information about the department such as professor's office hours & expertise, course prerequisites, etc. Users can also ask the assistant for general information about the university such as the history, mascott, and more.

The CSAI Voice Assistant Project Team is currently designing the wake-word solution for the voice assistant. This is to create a speech recognition application layer for the assistant which will activate our voice assistant by saying "Nimbus". We have collected wake word audio data on the name of the voice assistant "Nimbus" and non wake word which would result in false activations. With this audio data, we extract MFCCs as input features to feed the Gated Recurrent Unit. We are currently building and optimizing our Gated Recurrent Unit model and designing infrastructure to implement our current model.




# Summer 2019: Data Acquisition/Optimization
Natural Language Processing data acquisition and optimization of the current wake word solution.

# Fall 2019: Natural Language Processing Domain-Specific Implementation 
Applying the NLP layer and optimizing to make accurate queries for accurate predictions. Also scripting a site scraping program to obtain necessary information and adding such information to a look-up table for future access.

# Winter 2020: Infrastructure - Hardware/Mobile Application Design
Finalzing the NLP layer and implementing Google Cloud Platform Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech. The hardware and mobile application design will occur to complete the project for the end-to-end product.
